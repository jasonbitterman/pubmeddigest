**Journal:** Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research

**Publication Date:** 07/19/2025

**Keywords:** Humans, Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, Male, Female, Electrodiagnosis, Middle Aged, Adult, Neural Conduction, Physical Examination, Aged, Median Nerve, Action Potentials, Ulnar Nerve, Electromyography

**Abstract:**
To investigate the clinical significance of results in electrodiagnostic evaluations for carpal tunnel syndrome(CTS) and analyze the correlation between electrodiagnostic evaluations and physical examinations, 236 CTS patients and 96 healthy volunteers accepted electrodiagnostic evaluations. There were significant differences between CTS and control groups, mild and moderate patients, moderate and severe patients in CTS groups respectively, in terms of compound muscle action potential(CMAP), sensory conduction velocity of middle finger(SCV), distal motor latency(DML) difference between median nerve and ulnar nerve on the ring finger(△DML) (p < 0.05).△DML has larger area under curve of ROC curve (0.974) than CMAP, SCV and DML(0.748, 0.950, 0.958), then △DML could be included as valuable test for diagnosing and classification of carpal tunnel syndromes. There was low correlation between electrodiagnostic evaluations and physical examinations (rho < 0.4), so electrodiagnostic evaluation and physical examination should be combined to diagnose CTS. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic III.

## Description of peripheral nervous system involvement in wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis: A clinical and electrophysiological study.

**Journal:** Revue neurologique

**Publication Date:** 07/15/2025

**Keywords:** 

**Abstract:**
Wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRwt) is not clearly known to be associated with peripheral neurological complications. The aim of our study was to characterize neurological involvement in ATTRwt, as well as its evolution over time, using clinical and electrodiagnostic (EDX) data. We prospectively included patients diagnosed with ATTRwt who were addressed by cardiologists. All patients underwent neurological evaluation, including examination (neuropathy impairment score) and an EDX study including electrochemical skin conductance and/or sympathetic skin response testing. Motor, sensory, and small fiber composite sum scores were calculated based on the EDX data. Clinical and EDX scores were then reassessed during the follow-up period. Fifty-two patients were included, 94% of whom were treated with tafamidis. At inclusion 98% of patients presented peripheral nerve involvement at EDX, the most common being carpal tunnel syndrome (88%), polyneuropathy (67%), and ulnar tunnel syndrome (21%). Twenty-nine patients were reevaluated and mean follow-up was 16.7months with no significant change of clinical or neurophysiological data. In our cohort, a large majority of ATTRwt patients showed peripheral nerve involvement, generally expressed as the combination of different neurological syndromes (entrapment syndromes, large and/or small fiber polyneuropathy, radicular impairment). Polyneuropathy in ATTRwt seemed stable over our follow-up period. Clinical and EDX screening should be conducted in ATTRwt patients with symptoms suggestive of neurological involvement in order not to oversee these frequent complications which could affect therapeutic decision making.

## Glucagon-like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonist Therapy Is Associated With Fewer Medical Complications After Carpal Tunnel Release in Diabetic Patients.

**Journal:** Hand (New York, N.Y.)

**Publication Date:** 07/16/2025

**Keywords:** 

**Abstract:**
Diabetic patients experience carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) at high rates, have increased symptom severity, and experience prolonged recovery after carpal tunnel release (CTR). This study assessed the association of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1) therapy with postoperative outcomes after CTR in type II diabetic patients with CTS. Using the PearlDiver database, 25 229 diabetic patients with CTS who underwent CTR and were prescribed GLP-1 therapy were identified and exact matched to 25 229 controls based on age, sex, Elixhauser comorbidity index, tobacco use, obesity, hypothyroidism, and body mass index where available. Demographic variables and comorbidities were compared between groups using Kruskal-Wallis analyses for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables. Bivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted for 90-day outcomes and 2-year CTR revision. Patients on GLP-1 therapy had decreased risk of 90-day medical complications (odds ratio [OR] = 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84-0.96) and hospital readmission (OR = 0.85; 95% CI, 0.77-0.94) of 0.5% and 0.4%, respectively, compared with controls. No significant differences were found in 90-day surgical complications or 2-year revision rates between cohorts. There were no cases of aspiration pneumonia. The GLP-1 cohort had increased odds of higher 90-day total costs of care (OR = 2.42; 95% CI, 1.88-3.15). GLP-1 therapy is associated with reduced risk of 90-day medical complications and hospital readmission following CTR in diabetic patients, suggesting these medications may optimize comorbidity profiles via glucose control preoperatively. Future studies may examine whether GLP-1 therapy is associated with minimum clinically important difference in patient-reported outcome measures for CTS in diabetic patients.

## Misconceptions in Plastic Surgery: Crowdsourcing Public Perceptions of Plastic Surgery Urban Myths.

**Journal:** Eplasty

**Publication Date:** 01/01/2025

**Keywords:** 

**Abstract:**
Understanding public misconceptions about plastic surgery can inform plastic surgeons of the knowledge gaps among their patients and non-plastic surgeon colleagues about the field. This deepened understanding may aid in optimizing patient satisfaction and health outcomes. The objective of this study was to investigate the extent to which laypeople agree with common plastic surgery urban myths. A Likert scale-based survey of 10 popular plastic surgery myths was distributed via Amazon Mechanical Turk. Descriptive analyses and multinomial logistical regressions were performed to assess associations between respondent demographics and the likelihood of agreeing with each myth. A total of 2000 completed surveys were included in this study. Of the respondents, 41% believed that hand dominance is associated with a larger ipsilateral breast, 40% believed that underwire bras cause breast cancer, and 59% believed that typing causes carpal tunnel syndrome. Respondents who were male or younger than 35 years were more likely to believe in inaccurate myths. Health care workers had higher odds of agreeing with the claims that plastic surgery uses plastic (odd ratio [OR] = 2.49 [95% CI, 1.82-3.41]; <i>P</i> <.001) and that plastic surgery is almost always cosmetic (OR = 1.85 [95% CI, 1.32-2.61]; <i>P</i> < .001). Participants who underwent a plastic surgery procedure or consultation were generally more likely to agree with the listed myths. The general public and non-plastic-surgeon health care workers appear to have misconceptions about the scope and practice of plastic surgery. Open-ended patient-physician communication and patient-centered educational resources can potentially overcome plastic surgery misconceptions, thereby optimizing patient health outcomes and satisfaction.

## Diagnostic cut-off values and grading of carpal tunnel syndrome by shear wave elastography at different tunnel locations correlated with gold standard nerve conduction study - a case-control study.

**Journal:** Journal of ultrasonography

**Publication Date:** 04/01/2025

**Keywords:** 

**Abstract:**
The gold standard nerve conduction study for diagnosing carpal tunnel syndrome is often painful and has variable diagnostic accuracy. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of shear wave elastography in correlation with nerve conduction study. A prospective case-control study was conducted on 50 participants (50 wrists), including 25 carpal tunnel syndrome cases diagnosed by nerve conduction study and 25 healthy controls. Shear wave elastography assessed the stiffness of the median nerve at three locations: outside the carpal tunnel, at the inlet, and at the outlet. Cross-sectional area measurements were also obtained using B-mode ultrasound. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to evaluate diagnostic performance. Shear wave elastography and cross-sectional area demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy for carpal tunnel syndrome, with a cut-off value of ≥63.5 kPa inside the tunnel (mean of inlet and outlet values) and a cross-sectional area cut-off of ≥0.08 cm<sup>2</sup> at the inlet of the tunnel offering optimal performance. While cross-sectional area provided high sensitivity, shear wave elastography showed superior specificity; their combination improved overall diagnostic accuracy. Shear wave elastography values did not significantly differ across carpal tunnel syndrome severity grades based on nerve conduction study (<i>p</i> >0.05). However, shear wave elastography at the tunnel inlet differentiated severe carpal tunnel syndrome from non-severe cases (<i>p</i> = 0.045), with a cut-off of ≥126 kPa predicting severe carpal tunnel syndrome with 100% sensitivity, 77% specificity, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.871. Shear wave elastography is a reliable, non-invasive modality for carpal tunnel syndrome diagnosis, offering excellent specificity, particularly when combined with cross-sectional area. Additionally, shear wave elastography at the tunnel inlet may help identify severe carpal tunnel syndrome, supporting timely clinical decision-making and prioritization of intervention.

## Ultrasound Guided Hydrodissection of Median Nerve with the Use of 5% Dextrose in Carpal Tunnel Syndrome: A Case Report.

**Journal:** JNMA; journal of the Nepal Medical Association

**Publication Date:** 09/01/2024

**Keywords:** Humans, Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, Female, Median Nerve, Middle Aged, Glucose, Ultrasonography, Interventional, Treatment Outcome

**Abstract:**
Carpal tunnel syndrome is an entrapment neuropathy of median nerve in wrist presenting with symptoms like pain, numbness, and paresthesia in hand and lateral three fingers. Conservative treatments are effective for mild to moderate cases, whereas severe or refractory carpal tunnel syndrome may require surgical intervention. Hydrodissection, a technique involving the separation of the nerve from surrounding tissues, has emerged as a minimally invasive and effective treatment option for carpal tunnel syndrome, leading to faster recovery and lower complication. In this case report, a 48 years female with two years history of severe pain and paresthesia in right hand, underwent ultrasound-guided hydrodissection of median nerve with 5% dextrose. Following intervention, the patient reported decreased symptoms and expressed satisfaction with the treatment during subsequent follow-up after 2 weeks. Ultrasound-guided hydrodissection of median nerve with 5% dextrose is effective treatment modality for patients with failed conservative management of carpal tunnel syndrome.

## The Relationship between Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and Wild-Type ATTR Amyloidosis.

**Journal:** The journal of hand surgery Asian-Pacific volume

**Publication Date:** 07/14/2025

**Keywords:** 

**Abstract:**
<b>Background:</b> Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), which is frequently encountered in orthopaedic practice, is an early symptom of wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRwt). ATTRwt has a high misdiagnosis rate, making early detection difficult, which in turn delays treatment and results in a poor prognosis. Therefore, we herein investigated whether the early diagnosis of CTS leads to the early detection and treatment of ATTRwt, ultimately improving its prognosis. <b>Methods:</b> This study included 42 patients diagnosed with ATTRwt (34 males, 8 females; mean age: 77.7 years). We investigated the presence of a history of CTS, the affected side, the duration from the CTS diagnosis to ATTRwt confirmation, the number of deaths and the number of referrals from orthopaedic surgeons to cardiologists. <b>Results:</b> A history of CTS was present in 26 cases, with 15 being bilateral CTS. The average duration from the CTS diagnosis to ATTRwt confirmation was 6.4 years. Four patients died, and there were no referrals from orthopaedic surgeons to cardiologists. <b>Conclusions:</b> The present results showed that 61.9% of patients diagnosed with ATTRwt had a history of CTS, suggesting that CTS is a predictive factor for ATTRwt. However, the average duration from the CTS diagnosis to ATTRwt confirmation was 6.4 years, indicating a significant delay. One reason for this delay is that orthopaedic surgeons may not be aware of the relationship between CTS and ATTRwt, as suggested by the result showing no referrals from orthopaedic surgeons to cardiologists. <b>Level of Evidence:</b> Level IV (Diagnostic).

## Standardized High-Resolution Ultrasound Protocol for the Diagnosis and Monitoring of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome: A Mixed-Design Observational Study.

**Journal:** Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)

**Publication Date:** 06/23/2025

**Keywords:** 

**Abstract:**
<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common entrapment neuropathy. Traditional diagnostics like EMG and NCSs are invasive and do not visualize nerve morphology. This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of high-resolution ultrasonography in patients with CTS using a standardized scanning protocol and to evaluate the relationship between sonographic findings and traditional electrodiagnostic results. <b>Methods</b>: In this observational study with both prospective and retrospective components, 31 subjects were included. Between November 2023 and June 2024, 11 symptomatic CTS patients were scheduled for surgical decompression and 14 healthy controls were prospectively enrolled. Additionally, six post-surgical CTS patients who had undergone decompression between 2016 and 2021 were retrospectively included for comparative analysis. All underwent clinical and ultrasonographic assessments of the median nerve at predefined anatomical landmarks. EMG was performed in the CTS groups. Ultrasound was repeated at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively to monitor morphological changes. <b>Results</b>: CTS patients had significantly increased the median nerve CSA compared to controls. Postoperative ultrasound showed progressive CSA reduction correlating with clinical improvement and EMG recovery. The CSA correlated moderately to strongly with distal motor latency. <b>Conclusions</b>: High-resolution ultrasound is a reliable, non-invasive tool for diagnosing and monitoring CTS. Standardized protocols are needed to support broader clinical adoption and establish it as a standalone diagnostic method.

## Open fracture of the distal radius with complete laceration of the median nerve.

**Journal:** Acta ortopedica mexicana

**Publication Date:** 01/01/2025

**Keywords:** Humans, Male, Adult, Radius Fractures, Median Nerve, Fractures, Open, Lacerations

**Abstract:**
median nerve neuropathy accompanying a distal radius fracture is common. Differential diagnosis includes nerve contusion, acute carpal tunnel syndrome, forearm compartment syndrome or exacerbation of an idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome. a 44-year-old male presented with a right distal radius fracture after a motorcycle accident. He presented a 1.3 cm blunt wound situated proximal to the radiocarpal flexion crease and complained of well-defined numbness in the median nerve territory. The fracture was reduced and fixed using a volar plate and the median nerve was explored finding a complete section with a 2.0 cm defect. The carpal tunnel was released and a sural nerve fascicular graft was interposed presenting good results at final follow-up. a median nerve transection after a radius fracture is an exceedingly rare injury. This case report emphasizes the importance of an accurate physical examination including the initial neurological assessment.

## Tubercular Palmar Ganglion Presenting as a Severe Carpal Tunnel Syndrome - A Case Report.

**Journal:** Journal of orthopaedic case reports

**Publication Date:** 07/01/2025

**Keywords:** 

**Abstract:**
Tuberculous tenosynovitis is a rare condition predominantly found in developing countries that require prompt medical intervention. Due to its atypical presentation, diagnosis through biopsy and culture is necessary to distinguish it from other diseases. Compound palmar ganglion is an unusual manifestation that can cause swelling around the wrist joint and potentially compress the neural structures, resulting in carpal tunnel syndrome. A 27-year-old female, homemaker complained of pain and tingling sensations in her right hand. Radiological analysis revealed juxta-articular osteopenia with soft tissue swelling. Magnetic resonance imaging identified a spongy soft tissue lesion compressing the median nerve over the flexor retinaculum of the right wrist. The decision was to surgically explore and excise the lesion along with carpal tunnel release. Histopathological examination confirmed tubercular tenosynovitis. Tubercular compound ganglion is a rare condition that must be kept in mind while treating patients with carpal tunnel syndrome, especially in developing countries where tuberculosis is prevalent. Delayed diagnosis is common due to gradual progression and subtle symptoms except for swelling. Surgical intervention and antitubercular treatment are crucial components of compound palmar ganglion management. Early diagnosis and management are essential for preventing complications.

## Prevalence of carpal tunnel syndrome and its associated factors among patients with musculoskeletal complaints: a single-center experience from Eastern Ethiopia.

**Journal:** BMC musculoskeletal disorders

**Publication Date:** 07/09/2025

**Keywords:** Humans, Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, Ethiopia, Male, Prevalence, Female, Cross-Sectional Studies, Middle Aged, Adult, Risk Factors, Aged, Young Adult

**Abstract:**
Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a well-known chronic focal mononeuropathy caused by the mechanical distortion of the nerve at the carpal tunnel. It affects approximately 5% of the population worldwide and 12.1% in Africa. However, it has severe pain that causes discomfort and disturbs daily activities, the magnitude and its risk factors are poorly understood in Ethiopia. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of carpal tunnel syndrome among patients with musculoskeletal complaints in Dire Dawa, Eastern Ethiopia. An institution-based quantitative cross-sectional study was conducted on randomly selected 422 participants at Dilchora Referral Hospital from May-July 2023. The primary data were collected by using structured questionnaires and checklists. The history taking, anthropometric measurements, physical examination, and diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome were performed by the orthopedicians. The data were collected by the four BSc midwives under strict supervision. The data carefully checked for the accuracy, completeness, and validity. Next, data were put into Epi-data and then exported to SPSS for analysis. Descriptive statistics, bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were carried out. The prevalence of clinically confirmed carpal tunnel syndrome was 10.8% (95% CI: 6.99% to 14.6%). A multivariable analysis revealed that physical inactivity [AOR = 3.32 (95% CI: 1.95-5.52)], diabetes mellitus [AOR = 4.23 (95% CI: 1.47-6.97)], hypertension [AOR = 2.5 (95% CI: 1.70-5.65)], hand ratio < 2.1 [(AOR = 4 (95% CI: 1.80-9.66)], and wrist ratio > 0.72 [AOR = 2.1 (95% CI: 1.11-4.72)] were statistically associated with carpal tunnel syndrome. The prevalence of carpal tunnel syndrome among the musculoskeletal complaints is 10.8%. Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, physical inactivity, and a wrist ratio > 0.72 were statistically associated with carpal tunnel syndrome. Doing physical exercise, regulating blood sugar levels, and monitoring blood pressure were recommended.

**Publication Date:** 01/01/2025

**Keywords:** Humans, Male, Adult, Amputation, Surgical, Streptococcal Infections, Fingers, Streptococcus pyogenes, Necrosis, Hand

**Abstract:**
A case of a 40-year-old patient who presented to the clinic due to carpal tunnel syndrome of the left hand was presented. Four years earlier, the same patient underwent four-finger amputation of his right dominant hand due to fulminant necrosis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes infection. Descriptive history and the results of examination indicated that the patient adapted very good to significant disability of the hand. He had no constant pain, but only when the weather changed, which he rated at 3-4 points on the Numeric Rank Scale. The hand function examined by the DASH questionnaire showed a significant impairment - 42 points, but the patient declared that he functioned well in everyday life and even found a permanent job in a security company.

## Carpal Tunnel Syndrome in Surgically Treated Wrists with Kienböck Disease.

**Journal:** The archives of bone and joint surgery

**Publication Date:** 01/01/2025

**Keywords:** 

**Abstract:**
We hypothesized that the prevalence of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) in wrists with surgically treated Kienböck disease does not differ from its prevalence in the general population. This cross sectional study investigated 53 patients (25 males and 28 females) with surgically treated Kienböck disease for clinical and electrophysiological CTS. The mean age of the patients was 37±11 years (SD), and the mean interval between treatment and this study was 64±9 months (SE). Among these cases, 29 involved the right wrist and 24 involved the left wrist. Based on the Lichtman staging system, there were 17 stage II cases, 18 stage IIIA cases, 15 stage IIIB cases, and 3 stage IV cases. Surgical interventions included radial shortening osteotomy with plate and screw fixation in 38 patients, capitate shortening osteotomy in 12 patients, vascularized bone graft in 2 patients, and wrist arthrodesis in one patient. Five patients (9.4 %) had clinically and electrophysiologically confirmed CTS; all of whom were housewives, aged between 24 and 60 years. Two of these patients were explicitly treated for CTS in the Kienböck disease affected wrist. The prevalence of CTS in the wrists Kienböck disease was higher than 3-4% prevalence reported in the general population. These findings suggest a potential relationship between the two conditions rather than a coincidental occurrence within a similar population.

## Incidence of Posttraumatic Carpal Tunnel Syndrome After Perilunate Injuries.

**Journal:** Hand (New York, N.Y.)

**Publication Date:** 07/05/2025

**Keywords:** 

**Abstract:**
Perilunate injuries are a spectrum of high-energy carpus injuries with significant long-term sequelae and generally poor outcomes. Posttraumatic carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is an established sequela of these injuries, although its incidence varies widely in literature. This study aims to evaluate the risk of posttraumatic CTS after these injuries and contrast between nonoperative and operative perilunate injuries. The TriNetX database was queried for all patients treated for either closed or open management of a perilunate injury between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2023. Operative and nonoperative injuries were defined by inclusion/exclusion of their corresponding Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes. Posttraumatic CTS was evaluated using International Classification of Diseases codes and carpal tunnel releases (CTRs) tracked using CPT codes. Relative risk and odds ratios were used to assess differences between nonoperative and operative cohorts. A total of 5,167 perilunate injuries were included in this study. Of these, 2715 (52.5%) underwent nonoperative management, whereas 2,452 (47.5%) received surgical stabilization. Among patients treated nonoperatively, 93 (3.4%) were diagnosed with CTS within 1 year, with 98 (3.6%) requiring CTR. Among operative patients, 565 (23%) were diagnosed with CTS within 1 year of their injury, while 927 operative patients (37.8%) underwent CTRs. Conservatively managed perilunate injuries were at less risk for developing CTS or undergoing CTRs. Approximately 13% of perilunate injuries were associated with CTS within 1 year of treatment. Patients treated operatively were diagnosed with CTS approximately 7 times as frequently and underwent CTR more than 10 times more frequently than their nonoperative counterparts.

## What Do Patients Want? Outcome Measures in a Diverse World.

**Journal:** Journal of hand surgery global online

**Publication Date:** 09/01/2025

**Keywords:** 

**Abstract:**
Quantifying the outcomes of medical interventions has evolved, but challenges remain in hand surgery. Initially, hand surgeons used concrete assessments like range of motion and/or pinch strength. With a shift toward patient-centered care, numerous pathology-specific patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were developed. These measures typically used standardized closed-ended outcomes and mostly originated from Western country languages. However, it is unclear how well measures with specific items capture diverse patient values. Therefore, we used an open-ended PROM, the patient-specific functional scale (PSFS) to assess patients' difficulties associated with daily living for the following two common hand diagnoses: carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and trigger finger (TF), allowing us to evaluate the breadth of variation of experiences and treatment goals across cultures. We conducted a multi-institutional, international study on patients with a diagnosis of CTS and TF. Patient desires were recorded using the PSFS. Data were qualitatively interrogated using template analysis. Patient responses from 225 PSFS scores from three continents and five countries were evaluated. Patients provided diverse functional impacts from CTS/TF, which were categorized according to the International Classification of Functioning. There were diverse patient responses with variations in the proportion of domains represented in each country. Closed-ended PROMS (Quick disabilities of arm, shoulder, and hand; Boston carpal tunnel score; and PROM information system) did not fully capture the priorities identified by patients in each country. Although these PROMS measure specific outcomes, they do not address the broader range of issues that patients in different countries consider most important. This study highlights the diversity of patients' priorities in hand function. There is a clear cultural influence on the perception and prioritization of specific hand functions in daily life. Standardized tools with closed formats miss the richness of the individuals' goals, cannot adapt to new hand uses, and overlook cross-cultural differences. This weakness hinders the accurate evaluation of patient satisfaction and limits intercultural comparisons. Achieving truly patient-focused care necessitates more open and inclusive assessment tools.

## Surgical Management of Double Crush Syndrome: Outcomes of Cervical Decompression With and Without Peripheral Nerve Release.

**Journal:** Journal of hand surgery global online

**Publication Date:** 09/01/2025

**Keywords:** 

**Abstract:**
Double crush syndrome involves two distinct compressive lesions along a single peripheral nerve. Patients with compressive neuropathies at the wrist and elbow may experience exacerbated symptoms from cooccurring cervical radiculopathy. Surgical management aims to decompress at either or both proximal and distal sites. This study compares outcomes of anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) alone versus ACDF with subsequent peripheral nerve decompression. This retrospective study evaluated patients with double crush lesions, diagnosed with magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed cervical radiculopathy and carpal or cubital tunnel syndrome via electrodiagnostic confirmation. Two cohorts were matched and analyzed: (1) ACDF alone and (2) those with ACDF with subsequent peripheral nerve decompression. All procedures were performed at a single institution between 2004 and 2020, with a minimum 1-year follow-up. Postoperative symptoms, examination findings, patient-reported outcomes, and reoperations were compared. Among 130 patients (66 receiving ACDF alone, 64 with additional peripheral nerve decompression), those with both procedures had a significantly longer duration of preoperative radicular/peripheral symptoms (29.2 months vs 18.3 months). At the latest follow-up, patients receiving ACDF alone had significantly more persistent numbness (42.4% vs 17.2%), nerve irritability (21.2% vs 4.7%), and reduced 2-point discrimination (20.3% vs 12.1%) when compared with those who had bimodal decompression. Patients receiving both procedures reported significantly greater improvements in visual analog scale neck pain (-5.62 vs -3.63), visual analog scale arm pain (-4.73 vs -3.54), and neck disability index scores (-17.50 vs -6.80). Isolated cervical decompression may be insufficient for double crush neuropathies. Treatment of both proximal and distal sites can provide superior pain and symptom relief. Management of compressive pathology at both sites should be strongly considered by treating surgeons. Therapeutic III.

## Evaluating the Impact of Trauma on Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Onset and Postsurgical Recovery: A Retrospective Study in Orthopedic Practice.

**Journal:** Journal of hand surgery global online

**Publication Date:** 09/01/2025

**Keywords:** 

**Abstract:**
The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between previous trauma to upper extremities and the subsequent development of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). By comparing cases of traumatically induced CTS with idiopathic CTS, the study aims to evaluate differences in symptom severity and postsurgical treatment outcomes. Additionally, the study explores other factors associated with higher pain scores and longer lengths of care. A retrospective study was conducted on patients who underwent carpal tunnel release surgery by a single hand surgeon from January 1, 2014 to October 1, 2020. Pre- and postoperative care duration and pain levels, assessed using a visual analog scale, were the primary outcomes. To analyze the predictors of pain levels and recovery time, unadjusted means were generated, followed by the development of a model to account for potential correlations and contributions. The study included 478 patients (324 women and 154 men) with a mean age of 53.2 years, all of whom underwent carpal tunnel release surgery. Patients with traumatic injuries had higher initial and final pain scores compared with those with nontraumatic causes. Notably, trauma was not a significant factor in the length of care model, despite its association with pain scores. Meanwhile, worker's compensation was a factor associated with prolonged length of care. This study demonstrates that traumatic injuries and other factors, such as worker's compensation, gender, and race/ethnicity, significantly influence both pain levels and length of care in patients undergoing carpal tunnel release surgery. These findings emphasize that CTS can develop after trauma and is not exclusively idiopathic. Addressing various clinical and socioeconomic factors is essential for enhancing treatment effectiveness and managing expectations following surgery. Therapy/Prevention, Etiology/Harm; IV.

## Postoperative Tethering of a Transligamentous Thenar Motor Branch: A Cause of New-Onset Motor Deficit following Carpal Tunnel Release.

**Journal:** JBJS case connector

**Publication Date:** 07/01/2025

**Keywords:** Humans, Female, Middle Aged, Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, Postoperative Complications, Median Nerve, Decompression, Surgical, Ligaments, Articular

**Abstract:**
A 56-year-old woman underwent carpal tunnel release, which was complicated by postoperative tethering and local compression of her transligamentous thenar motor branch (TMB) by the radial leaflet of the transverse carpal ligament (TCL). This resulted in postoperative thenar dysfunction and motor weakness. Revision carpal tunnel release with neurolysis of the median nerve and TMB resulted in improvement. Postoperative tethering of a transligamentous TMB following carpal tunnel release may cause new-onset motor deficiency despite improvements in sensation. This can be treated with neurolysis of the motor branch and decompression of its course through the TCL.

**Abstract:**
To determine the outcome of longitudinal mini incision (1.5 cm) for carpal tunnel release (CTR), using the Boston carpal tunnel questionnaire (BCTQ) to measure symptomatic relief, functional recovery, and postoperative complications. Experimental study. Place and Duration of the Study: Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, The Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan, from October 2023 to September 2024. A prospective analysis was conducted on 77 patients who underwent CTR with longitudinal mini incision. Parameters evaluated were the outcome with BCTQ symptoms and functional scores for patients who underwent mini-incision CTR. This was recorded preoperatively and at six months post release with the questionnaire. Seventy-five patients showed significant improvement (score value + p-value) in BCTQ symptom and functional score post- release at six months after the release of CT via mini-incision technique. The only complications 6 (8%) recorded were pillar pain 2 (2.7%) and complex regional pain syndrome 4 (5.3%), which resolved at 6 months postoperatively. There were no injuries to the median nerve using the mini-incision technique, and no recurrence was recorded. Mini-incision technique was safe and effective for median nerve release in carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), along with excellent outcomes at six months when evaluated with the BCTQ symptoms and functional scores.

## Case Series: Re-Exploration Carpal Tunnel Surgery for Iatrogenic Median Nerve Injuries.

**Journal:** ANZ journal of surgery

**Publication Date:** 07/02/2025

**Keywords:** 

**Abstract:**
Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most prevalent peripheral nerve entrapment disorders of the upper limb worldwide, making carpal tunnel release (CTR) one of the most frequently performed procedures. While CTR is typically successful, a small but important subset of patients may experience failure of the initial surgery, presenting with persistent, recurrent, or new symptoms that may necessitate re-exploration. This case series details four patients who were referred to a single Plastic Surgeon in Melbourne Australia, with concerning new or persistent symptoms following initial CTR. For each patient, the primary CTR was indicated due to severe, unrelieved symptoms of CTS that were refractory to conservative treatment. CTR is generally a highly effective procedure with positive outcomes for most patients. However, in some cases, symptoms can remain unresolved or may even worsen postoperatively. Prompt identification and referral of these patients are crucial to achieve optimal outcomes. For those whose symptoms persist or worsen, exploratory surgery may be indicated for two primary reasons: (1) an incomplete release is suspected, or (2) injury to the median or palmar cutaneous nerve is likely. When exploratory surgery is considered, it should ideally be performed by a reconstructive microsurgeon. Early referral post-CTR is essential, enabling timely re-exploration and, if necessary, simultaneous definitive reconstruction, thereby improving the likelihood of successful resolution of symptoms.

**Journal:** Zhonghua lao dong wei sheng zhi ye bing za zhi = Zhonghua laodong weisheng zhiyebing zazhi = Chinese journal of industrial hygiene and occupational diseases

**Publication Date:** 06/20/2025

**Keywords:** Humans, Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, Female, Male, Retrospective Studies, Outpatients, Middle Aged, Adult, Hand, Pain, Hypesthesia, Aged

**Abstract:**
<b>Objective:</b> To analyze the situation of outpatient patients diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) due to typical hand symptoms and evaluate the diagnostic factors of CTS patients. <b>Methods:</b> Through an electronic medical record information system, a retrospective analysis was conducted on the data of outpatient patients diagnosed with CTS with "numbness and pain in the hands" as the complaints from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2022 in eight medical institutions including Peking University Third Hospital, Third People's Hospital of Guizhou Province, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital Bijie Hospital, then the demographic characteristics and diagnostic factors such as symptoms, signs, and auxiliary examinations were analyzed. Chi-square test was used to compare the differences in CTS diagnosis rates between different genders and age groups. <b>Results:</b> There were a total of 43105 outpatients with complaints of "numbness and pain in the hands" over the past 5 years, of whom 754 were diagnosed with CTS, with a diagnostic rate of 1.7%. The there were 166 males and 588 females diagnosed with CTS, and the diagnostic rate of female patients was significantly higher than that of male patients (<i>χ</i>(2)=158.13, <i>P</i><0.001). Among the CTS patients, the proportion of patients aged 45 to 60 was the highest (43.8%, 330/754), and there was a statistically significant difference in CTS diagnosis rates among patients of different age groups (<i>χ</i>(2)=36.99, <i>P</i><0.001). All CTS patients had varying degrees of hand symptoms, and some had definite abnormalities in auxiliary examinations such as physical examination, wrist ultrasound, MRI or neuroelectrophysiology. <b>Conclusion:</b> The diagnosis rate of CTS among outpatients presenting with complaints of "numbness and pain in the hands" is relatively low, and there are gender and age distribution differences. In addition to typical clinical symptoms, the diagnosis of CTS also requires objective evidence from physical examination and further auxiliary examinations.

## Evaluation of the Analgesic Effect of Adding Neostigmine to Lidocaine in Intravenous Regional Anesthesia for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Surgery.

**Journal:** Cureus

**Publication Date:** 06/01/2025

**Keywords:** 

**Abstract:**
Neostigmine, a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI), has shown potential as an adjunct to local anesthetics like lidocaine in peripheral nerve blocks, including carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). It may prolong analgesia by activating muscarinic receptors involved in pain modulation. Some studies report that adding neostigmine to lidocaine improves the duration of anesthesia and postoperative pain relief, particularly in upper limb procedures. However, results are mixed, possibly due to differences in doses or nerve barrier permeability. Overall, neostigmine's role in enhancing analgesia in nerve blocks such as Bier's block and CTS remains an active area of investigation. This study aims to assess the analgesic efficacy of adding 0.5 mg neostigmine to 2% lidocaine in adult patients undergoing upper limb surgery under intravenous regional anesthesia (IVRA). Specifically, it evaluates the impact of this combination on intraoperative and postoperative pain, analgesic requirements, and recovery profiles, thereby contributing to improved perioperative pain management strategies. A total of 52 patients admitted to Al-Fayhaa Teaching Hospital, Basrah, Iraq, were randomized into two groups of 26 patients each. One patient excluded from analysis from each group. In the control group, local anesthesia of 3 mg/kg lidocaine was administered with 40 mL of normal saline. While the neostigmine group patients received 3 mg/kg lidocaine with 0.5 mg neostigmine, the same amount of saline was administered. Physiological parameters, sensation, and motor activity onset time, and recovery time after intravenous regional anesthesia were registered. The neostigmine group included males (4%) and females (96%) with a mean age of 41.76±5.69 years, while the control group included males (20%) and females (80%) with a mean age of 37.6±5.00 years. There were no differences in the demographic data (American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), gender, weight), in addition to pinprick onset and recovery times, touch onset time, and block recovery time between both groups. A significant difference was observed in the age, surgical duration time, tourniquet time, touch recovery time, and motor block onset time between both groups (p < 0.05). In addition, no significant differences in postoperative complications were observed between the two groups (p = 0.074). However, there was a significant association in analgesic need, whether intraoperative or to reduce tourniquet pain, among the compared groups (p < 0.001). The addition of neostigmine to lidocaine in the surgical treatment of CTS shows no significant benefits regarding postoperative pain relief, but it is of benefit during the operation.

## Internal consistency, factor structure, and floor/ceiling effect of Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Questionnaire among people with carpal tunnel syndrome.

**Journal:** International journal of rehabilitation research. Internationale Zeitschrift fur Rehabilitationsforschung. Revue internationale de recherches de readaptation

**Publication Date:** 06/30/2025

**Keywords:** 

**Abstract:**
Quick Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Questionnaire (QuickDASH) is commonly used in carpal tunnel syndrome, while the knowledge on its psychometrics in this disorder is limited. The objective of this study was to explore the internal consistency, factor structure, and floor/ceiling effect of QuickDASH among patients with carpal tunnel syndrome. This was a retrospective cross-sectional register-based study among 1597 patients with electromyography-confirmed carpal tunnel syndrome. The internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach's α. Exploratory factor analysis was used to evaluate factor structure. Of 1597 respondents, 896 (56%) were women. The average age was 55.0 (16.3) years. The mean QuickDASH score was 38 (23.2) points. QuickDASH demonstrated an excellent internal consistency with α of 0.92 (95% confidence interval: 0.92-0.93). Exploratory factor analysis demonstrated unidimensionality. Item loadings were moderate to substantial for all 11 items, varying from 0.55 to 0.83. A significant floor effect was observed for nine of 11 items varying from 20 to 51%. A ceiling effect was observed for one item (#6 'recreational activities'). Despite its significant floor effect, QuickDASH can be recommended as a valid and reliable scale to assess the severity of disability caused by carpal tunnel syndrome.

## Translation and Cross-Cultural Adaptation of the Six-Item Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Symptoms Scale Questionnaire into Persian.

**Journal:** The journal of hand surgery Asian-Pacific volume

**Publication Date:** 06/30/2025

**Keywords:** 

**Abstract:**
<b>Background:</b> Numerous medical questionnaires exist to assess the quality of life in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). However, most of these instruments are available exclusively in English. Therefore, we decided to translate and culturally adapt the Six-Item CTS Symptoms Scale (CTS-6 SS) into Persian. This questionnaire was selected because it offers a subjective evaluation with a concise set of questions. <b>Methods:</b> The translation followed the World Health Organization's four-step protocol, including forward and backward translation, expert panel review and pre-testing. The cultural adaptation involved a multidisciplinary team ensuring relevance and comprehensibility for Iranian patients. The questionnaire's validity and reliability were assessed. The questionnaire was revised and then administered to 60 randomly selected patients diagnosed with CTS. <b>Results:</b> The translated CTS-6 demonstrated high comprehension and completion rates. The adaptation process addressed cultural nuances and ensured the scale's effectiveness in the Iranian context. Cronbach's α was computed at 0.903 to evaluate internal consistency. The test-retest data for the CTS-6 showed a normal distribution. <b>Conclusions:</b> The Persian version of the CTS-6 is a reliable and efficient tool for assessing CTS symptoms, facilitating accurate diagnosis and treatment in Persian-speaking populations. The brevity and clarity of the questionnaire enhance patient compliance and the reliability of collected data. <b>Level of Evidence:</b> Level IV (Diagnostic).

## Dynamic Analysis of Ultrasound Images of the Median Nerve Using Particle Image Velocimetry.

**Journal:** Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society

**Publication Date:** 06/27/2025

**Keywords:** 

**Abstract:**
Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) diagnosis is typically confirmed through electrophysiologic studies and ultrasound (US) imaging. Recent studies have suggested that median nerve gliding is reduced in patients with CTS. This study employed particle image velocimetry (PIV) to analyze median nerve dynamics. Ultrasound movies were captured during finger flexion and extension for 20 healthy volunteers (control group) and 20 CTS patients (CTS group). These movies were then analyzed using the PIV method. Within a 10 x 10 mm² region of interest (ROI) that included the median nerve and flexor tendon, the velocity magnitude and vector direction of movement were examined using PIV software. The maximum and mean velocity magnitudes were compared between the two groups using the Mann-Whitney U test. The maximum velocity in the ROI was significantly lower in the CTS group (9.3 ± 3.0 mm/s) than in the control group (11.5 ± 3.4 mm/s). The mean velocity was also significantly lower in the CTS group (1.7 ± 0.3 mm/s) than in the control group (2.5 ± 0.7 mm/s). Regarding motor properties, transverse motor velocity was significantly lower in CTS patients than in controls, while vertical movement showed no significant difference between the two groups. This study applied the PIV method to US images for dynamic analysis of the median nerve, revealing reduced gliding of the median nerve and flexor tendon in CTS patients, particularly in transverse movements. The application of dynamic analysis using the PIV method has potential for use in diagnosis and rehabilitation of CTS.

## The effect of education, diacutaneous fibrolysis, and self-mobilization on sleep quality in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome waiting for surgery: A randomized controlled trial.

**Journal:** Journal of hand therapy : official journal of the American Society of Hand Therapists

**Publication Date:** 06/26/2025

**Keywords:** 

**Abstract:**
Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) patients experience a wide range of sleep complaints. However, little evidence exists on how conservative treatment can improve sleep quality in these patients. To determine the effectiveness of a multimodal physiotherapy approach based on sleep symptoms and quality in patients suffering from CTS included in a surgery waiting list. A randomized controlled trial. CTS patients included in surgical waiting list of Spanish Public Health System were recruited. Patients were randomized into an education, diacutaneous fibrolysis, and self-mobilization treatment over 3 weeks (n = 20) or a control group (n = 22). Nocturnal symptoms, Medical Outcome Study Sleep Scale, Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire, and sensitivity of the hand were assessed after treatment, at 3- and 6-months follow-up. A general linear model of repeated measures was performed. Nocturnal symptoms (p < 0.1; d = 1.0-1.5) and Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (p = 0.01; d = 1.0-1.1) were improved in favor of intervention group at each follow-up. Also, sensitivity of the first three fingers showed better results for intervention group at 3- (p = 0.021; d = 0.5) and 6-months (p = 0.036; d = 0.8) follow-up. Five of the eight items in the Medical Outcome Study Sleep Scale reported significant differences at 6-month against the control group (p < 0.1). There was a significant increase in the amount of sleep in the intervention group (p = 0.006; d = 0.7). Finally, physical activity and splint influenced the results of nocturnal symptoms and awaken short of breath and headache. Education, diacutaneous fibrolysis, and self-mobilization may improve night-time symptoms and sleep quality in CTS patients awaiting surgery. Patients included were mainly severe, had associated comorbidities, and under-represented patients in conservative treatment studies.

## Randomized Controlled Trials Evaluating Carpal Tunnel Release Are Statistically Fragile: A Systematic Review.

**Journal:** Hand (New York, N.Y.)

**Publication Date:** 06/27/2025

**Keywords:** 

**Abstract:**
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assess carpal tunnel release (CTR) approaches often only report <i>P</i>-values for data that substantially influence surgical decision-making. This study employs fragility index (FI), reverse fragility index (rFI), and fragility quotient (FQ) metrics to assess the statistical stability of RCTs assessing CTR. Randomized controlled trials from January 1, 2000, to January 31, 2024, were queried from PubMed, Embase, and Medline. Fragility index is defined as the amount of outcomes required to alter significant <i>P</i>-value to nonsignificant <i>P</i>-value; and rFI is the amount necessary to alter nonsignificant to significant <i>P</i>-value. The 12 included studies yielded a total of 43 outcomes that resulted in a pooled median FI of 5 (interquartile range 4-6.5). Thus, the statistical significance of outcomes relating to CTR may be reversed by a median of 5 patients. Overall, statistical outcomes in RCTs analyzing CTR approaches were fragile and should be interpreted cautiously. To allow surgeons to make better-informed decisions, we recommend RCTs co-report FI, rFI, and FQ alongside <i>P</i>-values to provide a comprehensive reliability assessment.

## Beyond the Heart: Exploring Extracardiac Manifestations in Cardiac Amyloidosis for Early Diagnosis.

**Journal:** Current cardiology reports

**Publication Date:** 06/25/2025

**Keywords:** Humans, Amyloidosis, Early Diagnosis, Cardiomyopathies, Peripheral Nervous System Diseases, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Musculoskeletal Diseases, Heart Diseases

**Abstract:**
This review examines extracardiac manifestations of cardiac amyloidosis and their potential role in early diagnosis and management. Multisystem involvement, including musculoskeletal, peripheral nervous system, and other extracardiac findings are highlighted to serve as red flags for earlier detection. Early screening for high-risk individuals over 50 with CTS or spinal stenosis could enable earlier intervention. Peripheral neuropathy and CTS often precede cardiac involvement by 5-10 years, while spinal stenosis can precede it by 5-15 years. Other indicators include biceps tendon rupture, trigger finger, and gastrointestinal issues. MRI shows promise in detecting amyloid-related changes, especially wrist MRI. More studies are needed. Recognizing extracardiac findings may enable earlier diagnosis and intervention before significant cardiac dysfunction. Current workflows use extracardiac manifestations to detect cardiac amyloidosis after cardiac involvement. Integrating these insights earlier could identify amyloidosis years before cardiac issues, improving screening, patient outcomes, and guiding future therapies.

## Wild-Type Transthyretin Amyloid Depositions in the Subcutaneous Fat and Skeletal Muscles of a Nonagenarian Who Had Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction and No Myocardial Technetium-99m-Labeled Pyrophosphate Uptake.

**Journal:** Cureus

**Publication Date:** 05/01/2025

**Keywords:** 

**Abstract:**
Misfolded amyloid fibrils composed of transthyretin (ATTR) cause ATTR amyloidosis, which is a systemic disease. ATTR amyloidosis can be divided into hereditary and wild-type forms according to the presence or absence of transthyretin <i>(TTR</i>) gene mutations. Wild-type ATTR (ATTRwt) amyloidosis, a disease of the elderly, is more prevalent in men. ATTRwt is deposited in many organs and tissues, mainly the heart, lungs, ligaments, and tenosynovium. Orthopedic diseases caused by the deposition of ATTRwt in the ligaments and tenosynovium, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, biceps tendon rupture, spinal canal stenosis, and rotator cuff tears, are known to precede cardiac involvement by several years, leading to ATTRwt cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM). ATTR-CM can coexist with common heart diseases in patients of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and aortic stenosis. Heart failure and rhythm disturbance resulting from ATTR-CM is the leading cause of mortality in patients with ATTRwt. The median life expectancy after the diagnosis of ATTR-CM is low without the administration of disease-modifying drugs. The presence or absence of cardiac involvement is defined by a left ventricular (LV) wall thickness of ≥12 mm on echocardiography, regardless of body size or sex differences. Scintigraphy with bone-avid radiotracers, including technetium-99m-labeled pyrophosphate (Tc-99m-PYP), provides sensitive imaging of myocardial ATTRwt depositions that lead to ATTR-CM. However, there are few reports of histopathologic confirmation of extracardiac ATTRwt deposition prior to myocardial deposition demonstrated by Tc-99m-PYP scintigraphy. We report the case of a 92-year-old woman with acute HFpEF and aortic valve stenosis. Tc-99m-PYP scintigraphy revealed tracer uptake in the subcutaneous fat and skeletal muscles but not in the myocardium. We suspected the patient had ATTR. Biopsy of the subcutaneous abdominal fat with tracer uptake confirmed ATTR deposition. <i>TTR</i> gene sequencing revealed no variants, and the results of Tc-99m-PYP scintigraphy led to the diagnosis of ATTRwt with no obvious ATTRwt deposition in the myocardium. Extracardiac Tc-99m-PYP uptake in this case, as in orthopedic diseases due to ATTRwt depositions, reflects a condition prior to myocardial ATTRwt deposition and is considered suspicious for ATTRwt. The clinical significance of reporting this patient is to prompt future studies to test whether ATTRwt is deposited in the hearts of similar patients and whether early detection and treatment of ATTRwt will improve prognosis, which will require the accumulation of similar cases.
